| Project | Description | Demonstrated Technologies

| link:/eeny-meeny/[Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Moe]
| Basic example for Behavioral Programming (BP) concepts
| `bp-base`, BP

| link:/REST-API-testing[REST API testing]
| An example for testing a RESTful API microservice using Provengo/
| REST, state machine, microservice

| link:vps-customer-conversion[]
| Specification for a user onboarding business flow. This is an example of a specification validation use-case.
| `StateMachines` (state machines), hot/liveness (infinity requirements), `Ctrl.markers`

| link:insurance[]
| Online claim process in an insurance company. A multi-stage process, composed of deciding case properties, and constraining a state machine based on these properties.
| `Combi`, `StateMachines`, script generation, code generation, ensembles

| link:insurance-params-only[]
| Online claim for an insurance company. This model covers claim background and parameters, and specifies an expected result based on the parameters. Test cases are exported to TDD `.feature` files, or to custom ``.json``s.
| `Combi`, script generation, ensembles

| link:web-search[]
| Searching terms in https://ecosia.org[Ecosia search engine].
| bp-base, selenium-based direct actuations, script generation, test books

| link:web-search-bpmn[]
| Searching terms in https://ecosia.org[Ecosia search engine] - this time using a BPMN diagram as the main flow driver.
| BPMN, bp-base, selenium-based direct actuations, script generation, test books

| link:dummy-bank-storyline[]
| Basic demo for scheduling a meeting in https://dummy-bank.provengo.tech/[provengo-dummy-bank]. Using the Storylines DSL, the process is modeled like a user story.
| `Storylines`, selenium-based actuations, `Ctrl.markers`

| link:dummy-bank-statemachine[]
| Basic demo for scheduling a meeting in https://dummy-bank.provengo.tech/[provengo-dummy-bank]. Same process as above, modeled as a State Machine.
| `StateMachines`, `bp-base`, selenium-based actuations, `Constraints`

| link:survey-bot[]
| A model-building demo, which focuses on modularity. A little survey robot travels between four stations. Various requirement modifications change how the robot behaves.
| `EventCategory`, modularity, `gen-script`

| link:dummy-bank-combi[]
| Basic demo for scheduling a meeting in https://dummy-bank.provengo.tech/[provengo-dummy-bank]. Same process as above, this time modeled with a combination of Combi-based case parameters, and a state machine that is constrained by them.
| `Combi` `StateMachines`, `bp-base`, selenium-based actuations, `Constraints`

| link:run-code[]
| Using the https://docs.provengo.tech/ProvengoCli/0.9.5/libraries/selenium.html#_sn_runcodecode[`run-code`] command. The demo tests a data table, and validates that summary calculations are correct.
| web automation, Selenium

| link:runbook-svc[]
| Using the https://docs.provengo.tech/ProvengoCli/0.9.5/libraries/EventCategory.html[Event Category] library. A demo for a runbook for creating a service account. 
| event category, runbook

| link:runtime-values[]
| Using the https://docs.provengo.tech/ProvengoCli/0.9.5/libraries/runtimevars.html[Runtime Variables] library for performing sample-use scenarios and for reducing model size.
| runtime variables, web automation, Selenium, process customization
