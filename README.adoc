# Tech Demos
Some https://provengo.tech[Provengo] project to demo different aspects of our technology.

NOTE: Documentation for the Provengo tool is at https://docs.provengo.tech[docs.provengo.tech].

TIP: Visit https://provengo.tech[Provengo] to know what this is all about.

| Project | Description | Demonstrated Technologies

| link:/eeny-meeny/[eeny-meeny]
| Basic example for Behavioral Programming (BP) concepts
| `bp-base`, BP

| link:vps-customer-conversion[]
| Specification for a user onboarding business flow. This is an example of a specification validation use-case (no testing, just process verification and visualization!).
| `StateMachines` (state machines), hot/liveness (infinity requirements), `Ctrl.markers`

| link:insurance[]
| Online claim process in an insurance company. A multi-stage process, composed of deciding case properties, and constraining a state machine based on these properties.
| `Combi`, `StateMachines`, script generation, code generation, ensembles

| link:web-search[]
| Searching terms in https://ecosia.org[Ecosia search engine].
| bp-base, selenium-based direct actuations, script generation, test books

| link:dummy-bank-storyline[]
| Basic demo for scheduling a meeting in https://dummy-bank.provengo.tech/[provengo-dummy-bank]. Using the Storylines DSL, the process is modeled like a user story.
| `Storylines`, selenium-based actuations, `Ctrl.markers`

| link:dummy-bank-stateory[]
| Basic demo for scheduling a meeting in https://dummy-bank.provengo.tech/[provengo-dummy-bank]. Same process as above, modeled as a State Machine.
| `StateMachines`, `bp-base`, selenium-based actuations, `Constraints`

| link:dummy-bank-combi[]
| Basic demo for scheduling a meeting in https://dummy-bank.provengo.tech/[provengo-dummy-bank]. Same process as above, this time modeled with a combination of Combi-based case parameters, and a state machine that is constrained by them.
| `Combi` `StateMachines`, `bp-base`, selenium-based actuations, `Constraints`
