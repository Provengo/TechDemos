# Dummy Bank: Combi

A sample test model for a queue scheduling application for a bank. The tested site is available at https://dummy-bank.provengo.tech.

Basic concept: Model as combi for the case parameters, and a state machine for the user flow. Have the decisions that the combi makes constrain the flow of the state machine (sealed fate pattern).

IMPORTANT: For the automation to work, you need a running selenium server available from your machine. The simplest way is to run them locally. See https://docs.provengo.tech/main/site/ProvengoCli/0.9.5/installation.html[here] for installation instructions.
