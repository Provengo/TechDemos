# Web Search

A Provengo project for demonstrating the basics of Selenium-based actuation. This project searches for "pizza", "strawberry", or "banana" in the https://ecosia.org[Ecosia] search engine, and validates that pages containing these terms were indeed found.

IMPORTANT: This demo project does not look into any other features of the Provengo system, such as DSLs, multi-level event flows, optimized test suite generation, etc. Just Selenium actuation and some Provengo extensions to JavaScript.

CAUTION: For the automation sections below to work, you must have a *running* https://www.selenium.dev/[Selenium server (grid)]. The default automation browser is Chrome, but Firefox and Safari are also supported https://docs.provengo.tech/ProvengoCli/0.9.5/libraries/selenium.html#_classes_and_methods[(read more)].

* link:conf/provengo.yml[] Configuration file.

## Useful Commands

NOTE: In the below listings, we assume that `provengo` is in the path, and that `web-search` is the path to this directory (i.e. run this code from the directory that directly contains `web-search`). For UNIX systems, change `provengo` to `provengo.sh`.

### Randomized Dry Run 

Perform a single run through the specification, with no actuations. Good for "Sanity checks", e.g. to see examples of what can happen. Does not require any Selenium server.

    provengo run --dry-run web-search

### Randomized Run 

Perform a single run through the specification.  Selenium server needs to be running for this.

    provengo run web-search

Running in developer mode (visible browsers, pause on errors)

    provengo run --dev web-search

### Visualize the Spec

NOTE: This requires http://graphviz.org[Graphviz] to be installed.

Draw the specification in a PDF file.

    provengo analyze -f pdf web-search


### Sample Runs from the Spec

Sample 10 scenarios into a file. The scenarios are stored in a file called `samples.json` (this can be changed using the `-o`/`--output-file` switch).

    provengo sample --delete-previous --sample-size 10 web-search


### Run the Sample as a Suite

Run the sampled tests as a single test suite.

    provengo run --run-source samples.json web-search

### Create Run Logs

Creates a report of the tests run, in the form of a static HTML site.

    provengo report web-search


## NOTES

* This is a very basic sample project that does not cover all system features. For example, we left suite optimizations and DSLs out.
* To gain more visibility into what `provengo` is doing, invoke it with the `--verbose` flag between `provengo` and the verb, like so: 
```
    provengo --verbose run selenium-sample
```
* To display command options, type `provengo` in the console. To display the reference for a specific command, add `-h` after it, like so: `provengo.bar run -h`.
