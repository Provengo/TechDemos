= Mutation Testing Example


A project demonstrating mutation testing using runtime values and browser automation.

We test the Google search engine, by using a query and mutating it.

== General scenario:

. Send a query
. Sample number of results, store as `resultStats1`
. Change the query so that it's a narrower version of above query (that's the mutation stage)
. Send the mutated query
. Store the number of results as `resultStats2`
. Ensure that `resultStats1` is smaller than `resultStats2`

This scenario is implemented in link:spec/js/main.js[]. The test scenario map is available link:testSpace-annotated.pdf[here].
