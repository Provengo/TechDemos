= State Space Reduction using Runtime Values

The https://docs.provengo.tech/ProvengoCli/0.9.5/libraries/runtimevars.html[Runtime Values] library can be used to make state space adhere more to the specification, while also reducing its size.

This project demonstrates the concept using two versions of the same process-based specification. In both we choose a person out of a list, and perform actions with that person (e.g. sending emails). Also, if the selected person is Bob, we say "Hi!".

Note however that while the actions are the same, the state space of the version using RTV is smaller and more descriptive of the requirements. Especially the part where Bob is treated differently from the rest of the people - all other people go on one route, whereas Bob goes on another.

NOTE: Bob's special behavior works with both process implementations, as it only interfaces with events that appear in both.
