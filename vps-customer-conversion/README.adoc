# VPS Customer Conversion

A simple customer journey for an online SAAS company. During trial, the company allocates resources for the prospective customer (typically, a virtual machine and some storage). Thus, we do not want a client to stay in trial forever.

CAUTION: This model contains infinite loops. They must be limited by bringing in `flow-limitations.js` prior to sampling the model (calling `provengo sample`).

## Files

### Spec

For easy combinations, there are two folder here: `js` and `js-disabled`. Since `provengo` only looks in the `js` folder, you can easily disable files by dragging them to `js-disabled`, and re-enable them y dragging them back to `js`.
