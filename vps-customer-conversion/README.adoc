# VPS Customer Conversion

A simple customer journey for an online SAAS company. During trial, the company allocates resources for the prospective customer (typically, a virtual machine and some storage). Thus, we do not want a client to stay in trial forever.

## Files

### Spec

For easy combinations, there are two folder here: link:spec/js[`spec/js`] and link:spec/disabled[`spec/disabled`]. Since `provengo` only looks in the `js` folder, you can easily disable files by dragging them to `disabled`, and re-enable them by dragging them back to `js`.

link:spec/js/customer-flow.states.js[customer-flow.states.js]::
    The main customer journey state machine.
link:spec/disabled/loop-limitation.js[loop-limitation.js]::
    Constraints for limiting the loopholes at the customer journey.
link:spec/disabled/manual-work.js[manual-work.js]::
    Manual actuation layer.
link:spec/js/markers.js[markers.js]::
    Business-level markers on the process (e.g. who pays when).
link:spec/disabled/support-sm.states.js[support-sm.states.js]::
    Additional state machine describing customer support.
