# Web Search with BPMN

A Provengo project demonstrating how to mix https://www.bpmn.org/[BPMN] diagrams and web browser actuation. This project searches for "pizza", "strawberry", or "banana" in the https://ecosia.org[Ecosia] search engine, and validates that pages containing these terms were indeed found.

IMPORTANT: BPMN support is still in beta.

TIP: To visually view and edit the BPMN layer, consider installing one of the many BPMN editors out there.

## Files of Interest

* link:spec/bpmn/HighLevelFlow.bpmn[] The main flow, in BPMN. 
* link:spec/js/LowLevel.js[] Web automation layer
* link:config/provengo.yml[] Project configuration. Lists the BPMN diagrams that need to start automatically.

## Useful Commands

IMPORTANT: For the automation sections below to work, you must have a *running* https://www.selenium.dev/[Selenium server (grid)].  The default automation browser is Chrome, but Firefox and Safari are also supported https://docs.provengo.tech/ProvengoCli/0.9.5/libraries/selenium.html#_classes_and_methods[(read more)].

### Randomized Dry Run 

Perform a single run through the specification, with no actuations. Good for "Sanity checks", e.g. to see examples of what can happen. Does not require any Selenium server.

    provengo.bat run --dry-run web-search-bpmn

### Randomized Run 

Perform a single run through the specification.  Selenium server needs to be running for this.

    provengo run web-search-bpmn

Running in developer mode (visible browsers, pause on errors)

    provengo run --dev web-search-bpmn



### Visualize the Spec

NOTE: This requires http://graphviz.org[Graphviz] to be installed.

Draw the specification in a PDF file.

    provengo analyze -f pdf web-search-bpmn


### Sample Runs from the Spec

Sample 10 scenarios into a file. The scenarios are stored in a file called `samples.json` (this can be changed using the `-o`/`--output-file` switch).

    provengo sample --delete-previous --sample-size 10 web-search-bpmn


### Run the Sample as a Suite

Run the sampled tests as a single test suite.

    provengo run --run-source samples.json web-search-bpmn

### Create Run Logs

Creates a report of the tests run, in the form of a static HTML site.

    provengo report web-search-bpmn


## NOTES

* This is a very basic sample project that does not cover all system features. For example, we left suite optimizations and DSLs out.
* To gain more visibility into what `provengo` is doing, invoke it with the `--verbose` flag between `provengo` and the verb, like so: 
```
    provengo --verbose run web-search-bpmn
```
* To display command options, type `provengo` in the console. To display the reference for a specific command, add `-h` after it, like so: `provengo.bar run -h`.
